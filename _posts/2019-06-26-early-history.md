These are the stories of early days on the internet, since p2p networking is at the heart of the origins of the internet.


## Pre-History

[History of Border Gateway Protocol](https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/)
* ARPANet 1969
* USENET, 1979 -  Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
* Gateway-to-gateway protocol (GGP) 1982  - its only focus was routing based on the number of AS hops. GGP focused on routing internet transit the fewest number of autonomous system (AS) hops to a destination.
* 1984
  - FidoNet
  - Exterior gateway protocol (originally discussed in 1982) a tree-like distance-vector internet routing protocol.
  - Cisco Systems founded
* 1985 - The National Science Foundation begins to support advanced research and education in networking.
* Between the developments of Usenet in 1979 to the 1990’s, files sharing were primarily done through the use of bulletin board based systems.
* 1986 - The first super computers are connected to the internet. The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) initiated TCP/IP connections and operations. This becomes the first form of the internet backbone.

The events through the 1980s expose the need for an all-encompassing internet routing protocol. This is exactly when BGP is developed. On three sheets of paper.

* 1988 - Internet routing (BGP) -RFC 1058. This is the oldest distance-vector routing protocol in its modern context. This begins to lay the groundwork for BGP.
* August 1989 - Internet Relay Chat (IRC)


## ARPANet


* [Network Working Group Request for Comment:   1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1)
  **Host Software, Steve Crocker - 7 April 1969**

> The software for the ARPA Network exists partly in the IMPs and partly in the respective HOSTs.  BB&N has specified the software of the IMPs and it is the responsibility of the HOST groups to agree on HOST software.
>
> During the summer of 1968, representatives from the initial four sites met several times to discuss the HOST software and initial experiments on the network.  There emerged from these meetings a working group of three, Steve Carr from Utah, Jeff Rulifson from SRI, and Steve Crocker of UCLA, who met during the fall and winter.  The most recent meeting was in the last week of March in Utah.  Also present was Bill Duvall of SRI who has recently started working with Jeff Rulifson.
>
>Somewhat independently, Gerard DeLoche of UCLA has been working on the HOST-IMP interface.
>
> I present here some of the tentative agreements reached and some of the open questions encountered.  Very little of what is here is firm and reactions are expected.

* [How the Internet was born: from the ARPANET to the Internet](http://theconversation.com/how-the-internet-was-born-from-the-arpanet-to-the-internet-68072)
  >The openness of the RFC process helped encourage participation among the members of a very heterogeneous group of people, ranging from graduate students to professors and program managers. Following a “spirit of unrestrained participation in working group meetings”, the RFC method proved to be a critical asset for the people involved in the project. It helped them reflect openly about the aims and goals of the network, within and beyond its technical infrastructure.
  >
  >This particular culture informs the whole communication galaxy we call today the Internet; in fact, it is one of its defining elements. The offspring of the marriage between the RFC and the NGW are called web-logs, web forums, email lists, and of course social media while Internet-working is now a key-aspect in many processes of human interaction, ranging from solving technical issues, to finding solution to more complex social or political matters.


* [ARPANET establishes 1st computer-to-computer link, October 29, 1969](https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4399541/ARPANET-establishes-1st-computer-to-computer-link--October-29--1969)

>Originally funded by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), now DARPA, within the United States Department of Defense, ARPANET was to be used for projects at universities and research laboratories in the US. The packet switching of the ARPANET was based on designs by British scientist Donald Davies and Lawrence Roberts of the Lincoln Laboratory.
>
>**Initially, ARPANET consisted of four IMPs at:**

* the University of California, Los Angeles, which had an SDS Sigma 7 as the first computer attached to it;
*  the Stanford Research Institute's Augmentation Research Center, where Douglas Engelbart is credited with creating the NLS (oN-Line System) hypertext system, with an SDS 940 that ran NLS being the first host attached;
*  the University of California, Santa Barbara with the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center's IBM 360/75 running OS/MVT being the machine attached;
*  And at the University of Utah's Computer Science Department, running a DEC PDP-10 running TENEX.

## Network Control Protocol (NCP)

1970 the ARPANET had its first host-to-host protocol, the Network Control Protocol (NCP)

 public demonstration of the ARPANET and its potentials at the International Conference on Computer Communication (ICCC) held in Washington, D.C., in October 1972.

## Usenet - Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
1979

* [History of Computers - P2P](http://wiki.sjs.org/wiki/index.php/History_of_Computers_-_P2P_Networks)
  >Peer to peer networks can be configured over LAN or the Internet. Local area P2P networks can be configured to be either wired or wireless and allow the sharing of files, printers, and other resources between involved computers. Over the Internet, P2P networks can handle an extremely high volume of file sharing because the workload is distributed across many computers worldwide. Internet based P2P networks are less likely to fail or experience a traffic bottleneck than client-server networks for the same reason.[[3]](http://compnetworking.about.com/od/basicnetworkingfaqs/a/peer-to-peer.htm)
  >
  > The basic idea of P2P networking has been around since 1969, when the Internet Engineering Task Force pusblished its first Request for Comments.[[4]](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1) However, the first dial-up P2P network was created in 1980 in the form of Usenet, which was a worldwide Internet discussion system. The difference between other web forums and Usenet was that Usenet did not depend on a central server or administrator-- it was distributed among a constantly changing group of servers that stored and forwarded messages to one another in bursts called news feeds. Individual users could read messages from and post messages to a local server, which would then send posted messages around the world.[[5]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet)

>[Origins of decentralized computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing#Origins_of_decentralized_computing)
>
>The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of David Chaum.
>
>During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as Mix Network. It enabled for an anonymous email communications network which decentralized the authentication of the messages in a protocol which would become the precursor to Onion Routing, the protocol of the TOR browser. Through this initial development of an anonymous communications network, David Chaum applied his Mix Network philosophy to design the world's first decentralized payment system and patented it in 1980 (Patent US4529870). Later in 1982, for his PhD dissertation, he wrote about the need for decentralized computing services in the paper Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.
