When I first used this theme, it was in the middle of some updates, and I poked around the SSGiverse to see what else I could find.

I tried [Indigo](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo), a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/) indieweb theme. At that point I started using it for [web-work.tools](https://web-work.tools) and merged my [indieweb](https://web-work.tools/indieweb) content with it.  That site grew fast!

Now, I'm using [AngeloStavrow/indigo](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo), for [web-work.tools/indieweb](https://web-work.tools/indieweb), went back to [mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) for [web-work.tools](https://web-work.tools) and am using the **new** *and* **improved** [miklb/jekyll-indieweb](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb) for P2P\Decentralized Web Histories.

## Decentralized Web

**How did we get here?**

I came into contact with [@Kyle_DH](https://twitter.com/Kyle_DH), who inquired about [my services](https://web-work.tools/services/). In particularly, he asked about a list I have posted, and offered to pay $200 for an article on P2P history.

This site is where I'm organizing my research around P2P, and decentralized-web histories. Once I have a solid foundation created, I'll begin working on an article on the history of P2P around 2000 words of it. 

[@Kyle_DH](https://twitter.com/Kyle_DH) has been gracious enough to financially support this effort, and the content produced is a contribution to the public domain. I have already recieved $100 up front, the following $100 upon delivery.

Much thanks to Kyle for believing in me and this vision, and all of you for visiting!

I am so grateful to see the beginnings of a community form around these research efforts, which was the whole point of publishing any of it to begin with. If I'm going to be studying Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (oh my!), and writing about the same, it would be great to find a community of others working towards the same ends.

## A Circuitus Approach to Bitcoin History

In order to understand Bitcoin, it is important to understand the history of computing, cryptography, money, decentralized systems, law, and a number of other interelated subjects.

My approach is to gradually organize information on each subject so that the websites integrate with each-other, while remaining distinct.

## Indieweb Meets P2P History

It seemed fitting to use an indieweb theme for publishing content about the history of P2P and Decentralized web. Once I get things set up, we'll start to play around with what all is possible :D
