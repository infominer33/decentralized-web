The History of P2P technologies is generally broken up into 3 generations.

The first, being centralized, the second decentralized, and the third arising with the introduction of darknets.

[History of Computers - P2P](http://wiki.sjs.org/wiki/index.php/History_of_Computers_-_P2P_Networks)
  >Peer to peer networks can be configured over LAN or the Internet. Local area P2P networks can be configured to be either wired or wireless and allow the sharing of files, printers, and other resources between involved computers. Over the Internet, P2P networks can handle an extremely high volume of file sharing because the workload is distributed across many computers worldwide. Internet based P2P networks are less likely to fail or experience a traffic bottleneck than client-server networks for the same reason.[[3]](http://compnetworking.about.com/od/basicnetworkingfaqs/a/peer-to-peer.htm)
  >
  > The basic idea of P2P networking has been around since 1969, when the Internet Engineering Task Force pusblished its first Request for Comments.[[4]](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1) However, the first dial-up P2P network was created in 1980 in the form of Usenet, which was a worldwide Internet discussion system. The difference between other web forums and Usenet was that Usenet did not depend on a central server or administrator-- it was distributed among a constantly changing group of servers that stored and forwarded messages to one another in bursts called news feeds. Individual users could read messages from and post messages to a local server, which would then send posted messages around the world.[[5]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) 

**Host Software, Steve Crocker - 7 April 1969**

    > Information is transmitted from HOST to HOST in bundles called messages.  A message is any stream of not more than 8080 bits, together with its header.  The header is 16 bits and contains the following information:

>The origins of decentralized computing originate from the work of David Chaum.
>
>During 1979 he conceived the first concept of a decentralized computer system known as Mix Network. It enabled for an anonymous email communications network which decentralized the authentication of the messages in a protocol which would become the precursor to Onion Routing, the protocol of the TOR browser. Through this initial development of an anonymous communications network, David Chaum applied his Mix Network philosophy to design the world's first decentralized payment system and patented it in 1980 (Patent US4529870). Later in 1982, for his PhD dissertation, he wrote about the need for decentralized computing services in the paper Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.

  > The Internet is a shared resource, a cooperative network built out of millions of hosts all over the world. Today there are more applications than ever that want to use the network, consume bandwidth, and send packets far and wide. Since 1994, the general public has been racing to join the community of computers on the Internet, placing strain on the most basic of resources: network bandwidth. And the increasing reliance on the Internet for critical applications has brought with it new security requirements, resulting in firewalls that strongly partition the Net into pieces. Through rain and snow and congested Network Access Providers (NAPs), the email goes through, and the system has scaled vastly beyond its original design.

## Pre-History
[The History of Border Gateway Protocol](https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/)
* ARPANet 1969 ( or 1971 )
* USENET, 1979 -  Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
* Gateway-to-gateway protocol (GGP) 1982  - its only focus was routing based on the number of AS hops. GGP focused on routing internet transit the fewest number of autonomous system (AS) hops to a destination.
* 1984
  - FidoNet
  - Exterior gateway protocol (originally discussed in 1982) a tree-like distance-vector internet routing protocol.
  - Cisco Systems founded
* 1985 - The National Science Foundation begins to support advanced research and education in networking.
* Between the developments of Usenet in 1979 to the 1990â€™s, files sharing were primarily done through the use of bulletin board based systems.
* 1986 - The first super computers are connected to the internet. The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) initiated TCP/IP connections and operations. This becomes the first form of the internet backbone.

The events through the 1980s expose the need for an all-encompassing internet routing protocol. This is exactly when BGP is developed. On three sheets of paper.

* 1988 - Internet routing (BGP) -RFC 1058. This is the oldest distance-vector routing protocol in its modern context. This begins to lay the groundwork for BGP.
* August 1989 - Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

  >* aMule -aMule is a peer to peer file sharing application that works with the eDonkey computer network, but offers more features than the standard eDonkey client. It is based on the eMule sourcecode, and evolved from ?LMule and xMule. It is now the Linux client on the eMule links section on their webpage. As eMule, aMule is open source software released under the GNU ?GeneralPublicLicense.
